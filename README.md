# Systems-Level Interactive Data Exploration (SLIDE)  
## User-driven Visualization of Large-scale -omics Data on a Web-browser  

**SLIDE** is a tool for customized visualization and interactive exploration of high throughput quantitative -omics data. SLIDE can organize and visualize quantitative -omics data in expression based heatmaps on a standard web browser. It allows users to interactively navigate through the heatmaps 
and create sub-analyses of selected feature sets. It can be used to visualize the data at different levels of granularity through multiple simultaneous views.
